# CPlusPlusRepo
The repository of C++ files created when studying C++ with the book "C++ Language Tutorial" by Juan Soulie.

Note: .out files will only work on Linux and will require the original C++ file. Also, .out files are changed to .o due to my Raspberry Pi having to have its OS reinstalled and a new IDE was installed.

Note 2: Formatting disreprencies will be fixed after all files are completed
